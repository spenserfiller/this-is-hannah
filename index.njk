    <p>Welcome! I'm Hannah Filler, and I spend most of my time collaborating on writing projects with people from many backgroundsâ€”engineers, CEOs, investors, nurses, lawyers, product leaders, and fellow professional writers. I have an amazing team at my side at <a href="#">www.writing.coach</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Personally, my top 5 writing influences are Bob Dylan, Shakespeare, Bertrand Russell, Camille Paglia and Aristotle. Among web-based writers, I'm a longtime fan of Paul Graham, Shane Parrish and Tyler Cowen.</p>
    
    <p>I deliberately maintain a lightweight web presence, but I'm always happy to connect 1:1. Get in touch anytime via <a href="mailto:hannah@writing.coach">hannah@writing.coach</a>.</p>
